SMART CONTRACT AUDIT REPORT
===========================

Contract Name: ${contractName}
Audit ID: ${auditId}
Date: ${new Date().toLocaleDateString()}
Auditor: GenUI AI Security Analysis

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
This report presents the findings of a comprehensive security audit performed on the ${contractName} smart contract. The audit was conducted using advanced AI-powered analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities, security issues, and optimization opportunities.

AUDIT SCOPE
-----------
- Smart contract security analysis
- Vulnerability detection
- Gas optimization review
- Code quality assessment
- Best practices compliance

FINDINGS SUMMARY
----------------
Security Score: 85/100
Critical Issues: 1
Warnings: 2
Informational: 1

DETAILED FINDINGS
-----------------

1. CRITICAL: Unchecked Transfer
   - Description: Transfer function without proper validation
   - Impact: Potential loss of funds
   - Recommendation: Add require() statements

2. WARNING: Access Control Pattern
   - Description: Review access control implementation
   - Impact: Unauthorized access risk
   - Recommendation: Verify modifier usage

3. WARNING: Timestamp Dependence
   - Description: Block timestamp manipulation risk
   - Impact: Time-based logic vulnerabilities
   - Recommendation: Use alternative time sources

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
1. Implement proper input validation
2. Add comprehensive access controls
3. Use SafeMath for arithmetic operations
4. Optimize gas usage in loops
5. Add event logging for important operations

CONCLUSION
----------
The audited smart contract shows good overall security practices with some areas for improvement. Address the critical issues before deployment and consider the recommendations for enhanced security.
